// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

// Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
// vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
// files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
// It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
